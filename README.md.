# 🛠️ Git Workflow & Troubleshooting Case Study
**Author:** Frank Fru  
**Project:** Publishing a Local Infrastructure Project to GitHub

---

## 1. The Challenge 🚩
I set out to publish a multi-file Terraform project (`secure-url-shortener-tf`) to GitHub. What should have been a standard push turned into a series of interlocking system and synchronization errors. This study documents how I unblocked my local environment and established a clean CI/CD workflow.

## 2. The Diagnostic Matrix 🔍
I encountered three "showstopper" errors. Here is how I systematically resolved them:

| Error Message | Root Cause | Engineering Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fatal: repository not found` | Local Git pointed to a URL that didn't exist on the server. | Manually created the repository via the GitHub UI. |
| `fatal: index.lock: File exists` | A crashed process left a "lock" file, preventing all new commands. | Force-deleted the lock file using `rm -f .git/index.lock`. |
| `src refspec main does not match` | The local branch was empty, giving Git nothing to push. | Initialized commits with `git add .` and `git commit`. |

## 3. The Final Workflow 🚀
To solve the "interlocking" nature of these errors, I executed this recovery sequence:
1. **Unblock System:** `rm -f .git/index.lock`
2. **Stage Assets:** `git add .`
3. **Save State:** `git commit -m "Initial project files commit"`
4. **Establish Link:** `git push --set-upstream origin main`

## 4. Successful Outcome ✅
The final `git status` confirms a perfectly synchronized environment:
> *On branch main. Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. nothing to commit, working tree clean.*
